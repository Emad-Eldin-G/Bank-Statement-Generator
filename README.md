### Django
> Web Framework used
I used the Django web framework as it's built for the Python programming language, which offers really good versatility and ease of use. Django also has many out-of-the-box features that aid development and ensure code quality and integrity, some of those features include: Django REST framework, Django Models ORM, Django mail API, Django auth api.
